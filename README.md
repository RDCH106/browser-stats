# Browser Statistics
### Web Browser usage statistics 

### What is this?

The project is a proof of concept for collecting data using a spider and generation of JSON files that are easily consumable using common visualization libraries. The repository has two part:

1. The spider in [crawler folder](https://github.com/RDCH106/browser-stats/tree/master/crawler)
2. The visualization in [root project](https://github.com/RDCH106/browser-stats)

Primary data source is [W3Schools browser statistics](https://www.w3schools.com/browsers/default.asp).
